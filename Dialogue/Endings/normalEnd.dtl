You craft a tapestry of the gods in all their greatness
It is beyond mortal compare
[signal]
Athena praises you for your work, complimenting it as comparable to her own
[signal]
Yet
Though you feel accomplished, you feel as though you can surpass the gods with your prowess
Alas, there is naught you can do to fix your tapestry as is
Maybe another time
