Would you like to read the scroll?
- Yes
	It reads\:\
Zeus, with thunderous wrath and lustful gaze,\
Poseidon, who flooded lands in his craze,\
Apollo, whose pride eclipsed the skies,\
And Dionysus, drunk with passions' cries.\
Each scene depicted that mortal folly\
Is no different than the sinful gods' activities.
